# Vision_Transformer-Enc-Dec-model-
A deep learning project implementing Vision Transformer architecture for image processing tasks.
The dataset was taken from kaggle [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/preatcher/standard-ocr-dataset). The model is based on encode-decoder model, [Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf)
